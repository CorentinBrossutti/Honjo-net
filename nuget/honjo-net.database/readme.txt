You just downloaded the database library of the honjo-net framework.
This is the only library honjo-net.network does not depend upon as honjo-net.database is very much a standalone library.
It allows you to use databases and queries with more ease, namely with generic query parameters using @@ and varargs, or
the possibility to "unpack" your query data as an array.

ONLY SUPPORTS POSTGRESQL FOR NOW.
See https://github.com/Reymmer/honjo-net for informations and wikis.
