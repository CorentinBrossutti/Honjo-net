You just downloaded the crypt library of the honjo-net framework.
It is intended to encrypt data meant to be serialized and sent over network. This is why serialization libraries are set as dependencies.
Furthermore, it is primarily intended to be used along honjo-net.network to encrypt exchanges.
See https://github.com/Reymmer/honjo-net for more informations and wikis.
